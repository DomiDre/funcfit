	<h1>Hello World</h1>
	<p>FuncFit is an open-source project to calculate generic models & fit experimental data to it.</p>
	<p>The calculations are performed client side in the browser using web-assembly - to be up to speed but avoid the hassle of users having to install some specific software.</p>
	<p>For now this is just a fun project in the making.</p>
